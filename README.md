# ar-robot-control-demo
A demo project to control robotic arm real time using HoloLens 2. The original project was suspended in November 2022, and this page is created for archive purpose only.   
  
For the demonstration video, refer to the **Release** page.  
  
The repo is empty because this project involves Unity project files which are too large for GitHub to handle. The original project file is available upon request.
